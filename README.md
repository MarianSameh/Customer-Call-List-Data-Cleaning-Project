# Customer Call List Data Cleaning Project

## Project Description
This project involves cleaning and standardizing a customer call list dataset to ensure efficient and effective customer outreach.

## Objectives
1. **Filter Contactable Customers**:
   - **Exclude Non-Contactable Records**: Focus on customers who have a "No" in the "Donâ€™t Contact" column, ensuring we only work with individuals eligible for contact.
   - **Ensure Valid Phone Numbers**: Retain records with non-null phone numbers to avoid attempting to contact customers without valid phone numbers.

2. **Clean and Standardize Data**:
   - **Standardize Contact Information**: Review and standardize the format of phone numbers to ensure consistency across the dataset, including removing formatting characters or standardizing international codes.
   - **Remove Unnecessary Columns**: Identify and eliminate columns that do not contribute to the objective of customer outreach, streamlining the dataset for more efficient use.
